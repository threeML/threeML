## Data Analysis Question

**Are you having issues with a particular instrument's data?**
First make sue that the problem is not with how the data were obtained or with the offical instreument's software!
3ML is an abstract interface to many instrument software components... but some times we make a mistake in the interface.

**Do you have a statistics question?**
Concern about how to obtain or interpret the statistical output of 3ML?

**Are you curious about data reduction before passing to a plugin?**
The main stage of 3ML is interfacing a *model* to *data* in a *plugin* via the *likelihood.*
3ML provides some data reduction routines souch as converting slices of time series to plugins.
Are you curious about these routines?

**Are you curious about which plugin to use?**
There are several base plugins such as XYLike, and SpectrumLike. 
Most tasks for simple data can be completed or built from these.
Do you have a special data type that we do not cover?

**Other questions?**
