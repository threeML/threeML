Notes for XSPEC Users
=====================

Users coming from XSPEC typically have a few questions about getting started with 3ML

Why use 3ML over XSPEC if I am just fitting X-ray data?
-------------------------------------------------------

XSPEC is an amazing tool built by dedicated, friendly experts. If XSPEC is your favorite tool and you are only fitting x-ray data, then there are some marginal benefits:

- 3ML is a lighter install and natively in Python rather than a Python wrapper around XSPEC
- 3ML does many operations in parallel on HPC environments with little effort
- 3ML has many many more optimizers and Bayesian samplers

   *  global and local optimizer combinations

   * and more as they come into existence
- No parsing of text files to save results! 3ML has a serializable fit results format (FITS or HDF5) that is portable and machine readable.
- The modularity of 3ML means that the types of data it can fit will grow quickly


Do I need a new plugin for my instrument?
-----------------------------------------
- If it is an X-ray instrument that has PHA1 data, BAK files, RSPs and ARFs, nope! This is handled by the OGIPLike plugin. 
- Think of OGIPLike as an XSPEC-like object. Feed your data in and pass it to to the JointLikelihood or BayesianAnalysis objects. You need one plugin per observation. 
- OGIPLike is simply provides a wrapper around DispersionSpectrumLike that reads standard OGIP files. We are strict about following the OGIP standard.


Can I use XSPEC models?
-----------------------
- Yes!
- astromodels provides and interface to XSPEC models. See details in the modeling section.
- We are currently building our own set of standard models in XSPEC. We already have **APEC**, **PhAbs**, **Wabs**, **Tbabs** etc. So you can try those out first. 

Can I trust the results of the fits? 
------------------------------------

- With each build of 3ML, we always test the code automatically against XSPEC to ensure fitting (up to factor) and RSP convolution give the same results.
- You can always try yourself as the file types are the same. Expect differences in fit results that could be due to the underlying fitting engines.


How do I fake a dummy response to fit optical data or a background model?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- DON'T DO THAT!
- Since 3ML is not limited to a rigid data format, we have custom plugins for photometric data. You simply need to provide the filter name and magnitude. See the docs for more details. 
- We have the ability to model background spectra along with source spectrum. Check out the background modeling n the docs.

How do I choose the likelihood statistic for my fit?
----------------------------------------------------
- It is possible, but if your PHA files are formatted correctly, we probe them and choose the **correct** likelihood for your data.
- We do support rebinning of data, but not for the purposes of moving from the Poisson regime to the so-called $\chi^2$ regime. This is an incorrect and bad practice. 

How do I plot *unfolded data points* along with my fit?
-------------------------------------------------------
- You can't and you shouldn't
