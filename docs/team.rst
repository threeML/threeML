Project & Team
##############

This page describes the *TheeML* project organisation and the main roles and responsibilities in the *TheeML* team.
This structure was set in place in 2024, but we expect this structure to evolve over the coming years,
adapting to the size and composition of the *TheeML* development team, and the requirements and needs of scientists and
projects using *TheeML*.
If you would like to become part of the *TheeML* team, please get in contact. **Help is always welcome!**


Overview
********
The following sections describe the major roles and responsibilities in the *TheeML* team:

* `Coordination Committee`_
* `Principal Investigator`_
* `Lead developers`_
* `Sub-package and plug-in maintainers and point of contacts`_
* `Contributors and previous core developers`_
* `Supporting institutions`_
* `Grants`_


Coordination Committee
************************

The *TheeML* coordination committee (CC) is the board that is responsible to promote, coordinate and steer *TheeML* developments.
It also serves as main contact point for the *TheeML* project.
The CC is composed by the *TheeML* principal investigator, release manager, and plug-ins point of contacts.

Responsibilities include:
=========================

- Being the point of contact for the *TheeML* project.
- Promote the use of *TheeML* by new projects.
- Keep the overview of ongoing activities, schedules and action items and follow up to make sure all important things get done.
- Make decisions on the scope, content and development priorities for the *TheeML* package.
- Support and grow the *TheeML* team (help find people-power and funding)
- Support and coordinate the use of *TheeML* for scientific or technical studies and papers
- Organise and drive all non-technical aspects of the project on a day-to-day basis.
- Keep an overview and help coordinate all activities that have some involvement of *TheeML*, such as e.g. papers, presentations or posters about or using *TheeML* at gamma-ray or X-ray astronomy meetings or conferences, or tutorials at schools / workshops on gamma-ray astronomy data analysis.
- Manage the *TheeML* developer / maintainer / contributor team. Distribute tasks and assign responsibilities to other *TheeML* developers.
- Ensure that anyone interested in contributing to *TheeML* development has good resources (documentation, communication, mentoring) to get started. Specifically: maintain the *TheeML* developer documentation that describes all aspects of *TheeML* development (code, testing, documentation, processes).
- Organise *TheeML* developer calls and coding sprints via *TheeML*-meetings
- Schedule *TheeML* releases and define which fixes and features go in which release, taking the needs of people and projects using *TheeML* as well as available manpower for developments into account. Either execute releases directly or assign a release manager.
- Monitor and assign of issues and pull requests,
- Ensure *TheeML* infrastructure is well set up and maintained (issue tracker and pull requests on Github, continuous integration tests, documentation builds, releases and distribution).

**Current CC members:**

* Nicola Omodei (PI) - Stanford University
* Niccolò Di Lalla (Release manager, IXPE) - Stanford University
* somenone (HAWC) - Institution
* Israel Martinez Castellanos (cosipy) - NSFC
