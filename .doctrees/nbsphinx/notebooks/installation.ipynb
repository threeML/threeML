    "# Installation\n",
    "3ML brings together multiple instrument and fitting software packages into a common framework. Thus, installing all the pieces can be a bit of a task for the user. In order to make this a less painless process, we have packaged most of the external dependencies into conda (see below). However, if you want more control over your install, 3ML is available on PyPI via pip. If you have issues with the installs, first check that you have properly installed all the external dependencies that *you* plan on using. Are their libraries accessible on you system's standard paths? If you think that you have everything setup properly and the install does not work for you, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/threeML/threeML/issues) and we will do our best to find a solution.\n",

    "## Conda installation (suggested)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is a platform independent package manager. It allows to install 3ML (and a lot of other software) without the need\n",
    "to compile anything, and in a completely separate environment from your system and your system python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you don't know Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with conda, install 3ML with the automatic script which will take care of everything:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threeML/threeML/master/install_3ML.sh)\n",
    "2. Run the script with `bash install_3ML.sh`. If you plan to use XSPEC models use `bash install_3ML.sh --with-xspec`.\n",
    "3. The script will install 3ML and then create a `threeML_init.sh` script and a `threeML_init.csh` script. Source the former if you are using Bash\n",
    "(`source threeML_init.sh`) and the second one if you are using Csh/Tcsh (`source threeML_init.csh`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you already know Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Conda and you already have it installed, you can install 3ML by creating an environment with:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name threeML -c conda-forge python=3.7 numpy scipy matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",

    "conda activate threeML\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge -c threeml astromodels threeml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you also need XSPEC models you can install them by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c xspecmodels xspec-modelsonly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
